<h1>How I got into web development - an epiphany.</h1>

<p>This post is inspired by <a href="http://http://lea.verou.me/2012/05/how-i-got-into-web-development-the-long-version/">Lea Verou</a>, who writes about how she got into web development in the hope it might help some upcoming developers. It also seems to me to be a great place to start a new blog, something I've been meaning to do for a long time.</p>

<div class="site_wrap wrap">
I am born in 1975.

When I am around 12 my dad brings home an <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Acorn_Electron">Acorn Electron</a> <img class="left" src="http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/0/03/Acorn_Electron_4x3.jpg/320px-Acorn_Electron_4x3.jpg" />. It has no hard drive. We wire it up to an old cassette deck so we can load and save programs we write in BASIC. I mostly program tunes using the SOUND command and a lot of random numbers. Later we have a Commodore 64, but by then my brother is showing a greater aptitude for real coding, and I'm using the thing for sampling and MIDI sequencing.

I don't touch a word of JavaScript until 2007.

In the intervening period I grow up in Scotland, quit Architecture, tour America as a guitar tech, spend several years making music in Edinburgh, then London, then Manchester, win a BBC award for playing sax, go back to university to study acoustics, get a degree, set up a touring theatre company, make a couple of albums (that can still be found on iTunes if you know where to look), then lose the plot and spend several winters working in ski resorts.

Somewhere along the line I fall into making websites. None of the musicians I work with have the patience to fight Internet Explorer, but projects need to be promoted and there's no question of being able to pay someone else to do it. I'm the one who's mug enough to spend days cursing at a screen until something presentable emerges. This is more or less the standard process for dealing with Internet Explorer, but I am not to know this, because I don't yet know any other web developers. I know Photoshop, I'm teaching myself HTML and CSS, and I have patience.

Fast forward to 2007. Now I'm back in London, working for an ad agency. I'm at the bottom of the chain, the HTML and CSS guy, while my colleagues, <a href="http://twitter.com/imcg">@imcg</a> and <a href="twitter.com/CraigDodd">@CraigDodd</a> are doing Flash. I'm banging on about separating semantics from presentation, they're making stuff fly round the screen. But they're also dabbling with JavaScript, and they're having some success with a new library called <a href="http://jquery.com">jQuery</a>. It's at version 1.2.3. My interest is piqued, and I start reading everything I can about coding, and about jQuery, and ultimately about writing plugins to make jQuery do things it doesn't do out of the box.

And then, one week on holiday, I'm walking in the mountains and I'm looking at scenery as I walk along, and watching how the nearest mountains move past me faster than the farthest, and how they almost appear to be like flat layers sliding over each other, and...

...WAIT A MINUTE, I CAN DO THAT WITH DIVS!

All I need to do is take some mouse positions, some absoluletely positioned divs, some dimensions, add them all together, and hey presto. How hard can it be? I don't yet know how to do any of this stuff, but I know it can be done, and this is a great way to learn how to build a jQuery plugin, and to learn how to code JavaScript. I'm excited! I'm going to teach myself some shit! When I get back to London, I make sketches, I do some Maths, I spend a few nights thinking very hard and coding. It feels quite alien, because the last time I coded any proper logic I was 14, and we didn't have functions, only PROCEDURES and GOTO statements, which were then saved onto a cassette tape. But finally I produce... a script! I also make a demo page that shows it in action, and I'm so pleased with myself I submit it to jQuery plugins site. Someone has already taken the name 'parallax' so I call it '<a href="http://stephband.info/jquery.parallax/">jParallax</a>'. There are hundreds of other plugins up there, so I don't really think anything of it.

My colleagues at work are suitably encouraging, but they are probably just happy that I'm getting some sleep again, and not so grumpy at work. I get my head down and catch up with some websites. I don't really have a use for jParallax yet. I can think of some ways it could be used for interfaces, but I'm not quite ready for another coding marathon just yet.

After three weeks I get curious and decide to google 'jParallax', just to see if anyone has picked it up and looked at it. Google says:

<blockquote>About 40,000 results.</blockquote>

Exc-u-u-use me?

I can't believe it. I run the search again.

<blockquote>40,000 results.</blockquote>

Oh my... jParallax has been blogged on <a href="http://ajaxian.com/archives/jparallax-turns-elements-into-a-viewport">Ajaxian</a> and from there has spread across the nets, and I have no idea. Frankly, I am embarrassed. My little learn-to-code-JavaScript project has just gone global, warts and all: it's appallingly badly coded, very ill-tested, and my server has gone down as a result of the traffic. Now I have to actually make it work.

The following few weeks are hard. Late nights, a lot of wrong turns, an annoyed girlfriend, to whom I can't sufficiently explain why this thing is important, daytimes at work bleary-eyed and grumpy, but learning, learning, learning all that I can about manipulating the browser. Eventually I release a plugin that really does work cross-browser, and although the code is still pretty novice, I am proud of it, to a degree, and even better: I can now see where and how the code can be improved, and what I still have to learn in order to refactor it. People start to use it in their sites.

Although I have no idea, the effort is about to pay off.

I'm getting a little tired of London, and when a few months later the banking crash matures into a 'crisis' and my bosses are looking for people to axe, I volunteer for the chop.

I want to improve my dodgy french. I go to Switzerland without a job, but armed with a deceptively simple plan: find a job. I'm immediately a bit taken aback to discover that here, in the birthplace of the World Wide Web, there are not too many agencies doing web development, and very few of those are based in the french speaking part. In fact there is only one real option, and they aren't returning my emails. With the looming prospect of having to go back to freelancing in London, one day I find their address and knock on their door, CV in hand, and persuade them to take a look at it. They pause.

Wait, <i>you're</i> that guy who made jParallax?

They hire me.

Now, today, I have spent nearly 4 years in Switzerland, I have worked for some great clients, made social networks, experienced life in a startup, and in the last year started my own web development agency, Cruncher (cruncher.ch), with the excellent <a href="http://twitter.com/mbi">@mbi</a>.

I've had so much to do that I'm guilty of not having kept jParallax very up-to-date. Which is sad, because it was the project that got me here.

There is no discovery without exploration; there is no exploration without curiosity. The web rewards curiosity because there are always new things to explore and new discoveries to be made. This is not going to stop any time soon: there are a whole breed of new handheld devices that are set to dominate the web within the next couple of years, and plenty of problems to be solved in supporting them.

Being a musician is not so far removed from being a front-end developer: you spend a lot of time concentrating, practising, exploring, discovering, learning new techniques, until you manage to create... a thing. Front-end development is a creative act that is half design, half engineering. There is no single pathway to becoming one, but you have to have the curiosity that drives you to explore.

The magic of the web is that all the information about how to build the web is on the web. If you're curious enough, you'll find it, and all you need is a browser and a text editor to get you started.
